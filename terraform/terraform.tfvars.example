# Terraform Variables - Example Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your deployment

# ===== REQUIRED SETTINGS =====

# AWS region to deploy to
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Name of your EC2 key pair (must exist in AWS Console -> EC2 -> Key Pairs)
# Create one first: EC2 Console -> Key Pairs -> Create Key Pair
key_pair_name = "my-key-pair"

# Your IP address for SSH access (get your IP from https://whatismyip.com)
# Format: ["YOUR_IP/32"] for single IP or ["0.0.0.0/0"] for anywhere (not recommended)
ssh_allowed_cidrs = ["1.2.3.4/32"]  # Replace with your actual IP

# Git repository settings
git_repo_url = "https://github.com/shuyangw/Homeguard.git"

# Alpaca API credentials (paper trading)
# IMPORTANT: For security, set these via environment variables instead:
#   export TF_VAR_alpaca_key_id="your_key_here"
#   export TF_VAR_alpaca_secret="your_secret_here"
# Or uncomment below (less secure - don't commit this file to git!)
# alpaca_key_id = "your_paper_key_id_here"
# alpaca_secret = "your_paper_secret_here"

# ===== INSTANCE CONFIGURATION =====

# Instance type (t4g.small = $12/month, t4g.medium = $24/month)

# ===== OPTIONAL FEATURES (Set to true to enable) =====

# Static IP address (costs $0/month if instance running, $3.60/month if stopped)
