# Frequency for tearsheet data resampling to reduce file size
# Options: full (no resampling), H (hourly), D (daily), W (weekly)
# Daily recommended for most users (393x smaller files, 99% accuracy)
# Hourly for day traders (35x smaller, 99.5% accuracy)
# Full for maximum precision (100% accuracy, but 100+ MB files)
